# I. Project Overview
HeritagePulsePH is a digital platform that aims to preserve and promote Philippine folk dance traditions. It provides a centralized repository of dance documentation, choreography, historical context, and multimedia resources. Targeting educators, researchers, and cultural enthusiasts, the platform enhances cultural education and identity while addressing the fragmented access to cultural resources. By 2025, it seeks to document 70% of known folk dances and improve user engagement and resource accessibility.
