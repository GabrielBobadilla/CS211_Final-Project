# I. Project Overview
HeritagePulsePH is a digital platform that aims to preserve and promote Philippine folk dance traditions. It provides a centralized repository of dance documentation, choreography, historical context, and multimedia resources. Targeting educators, researchers, and cultural enthusiasts, the platform enhances cultural education and identity while addressing the fragmented access to cultural resources. By 2025, it seeks to document 70% of known folk dances and improve user engagement and resource accessibility.
# II. Applied Python Concepts and Libraries
The project utilizes Python concepts and libraries such as Tkinter for the graphical user interface, Pillow for image processing, and canvas-scrollbar integration for dynamic content navigation. Key features include dynamic UI updates, error handling for robust performance, and file management for efficient retrieval and display of multimedia resources.
